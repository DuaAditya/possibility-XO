# possibility-XO
Java program to calculate time complexity for an array and finding all possibilities to replace '$' with 'X' and 'O'.


This program takes the input as a string. If the input includes '$', then it counts all the possibilities when
all the '$' can be replaced with 'X' and 'O'.
Then with the help of 2 nested for-loops, it replaces them and prints them as well.
With the help of try-catch, it also writes the input and all the possibilities in a .txt file.

Furthermore, it can count the time taken for the whole program to finish.

The main objective was to find out time taken by the array-list.
